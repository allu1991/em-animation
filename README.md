# Evermade animation

Just some [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) animation experimentation. Bootstrapped with a minimal Vite setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Setup

Run the following commands


**Install dependencies (only the first time)**
`npm install`

**Run the local server (by default at localhost:8080)**
`npx vite` or `npm run dev`

**Build for production in the dist/ directory**
`npx vite build`

**Deploy to Github pages using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) package**
`gh-pages -d dist`
